Polygon Low-Information Calculation System: PLICS! A script developed by me that calculates the properties of any polygon from a shard of information! An small project, but one that is unique and is a fun challenge. this project, still in development, is hardly useful for anyone aside from me, and maybe a lucky 8th grader. Its simple and honestly quite stupid by itself, but it was never meant to be something big: it's just somthing for me to train my skills. If for any reason you find yourself interested, book a therapist, and if they tell you that you dont have some kind of rather unique math-related mental illness, the code is open-source, so feel free to change things to your needs, add slightly unrelated features, add extremely unrelated ones, fix problems im too lazy, or too dumb, to fix myself. The code is mostly based of:

Basic Functions You Will Learn 15 Minutes In Any Tutorial
If-Else Chains
Bad Math
Lack Of Comments
Tab Hell
1 Letter Long Variables That Are Going To Be A Hell To Change Into Something Diferent
Poor implementation of functions i stole from stackoverflow

And much more! At the time that im writing this, the code barely has 100 lines, so you can imagine what it looks like when its done. If for some stupid reason you want to download this disaster, i will be making updates with as much frequency as i feel like, and well, its python, as long as you have python on your machine, and as long as you can read this with it, you likely can run it. If you want to roast me, or politely dox me, feel free to do so at my Twitter @malditotanuki.
